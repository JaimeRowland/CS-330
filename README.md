1.	How do I approach designing software?
I usually start out when developing software by doing a comprehensive analysis of the project's requirements to get a decent high-level perspective of what it is that I'm actually designing. After it is complete, I start tasking out each component of the project into category buckets for eventual job distribution. I then begin genuinely developing the objects at hand after that is finished.  I think this method will really work out well for me in the future.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
When it comes to developing the software itself, I start by generating a workable minimal viable product to present to my customer in order to demonstrate that the idea is sound and to solicit input in order to make the program as user-tailored as possible. More of these development/feedback cycles will only take up the remaining development time.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
In order to show my client that the idea is sound and to get their feedback on how to make the program as user-tailored as possible, I begin by creating a functional minimum viable product before moving on to the actual software development. Only the remaining development time will be used for more of these development/feedback cycles.
